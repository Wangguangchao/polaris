Shumai
======

Shumai is _the_ Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for fixed-wing aircraft. It provides realtime orientation data to allow for higher-level navigation software to be developed.

In this first release only roll and pitch are included but yaw, position and wind estimation will follow shortly.

Shumai was developed by [Tim Trueman](http://github.com/timtrueman) and Ryan Beall. It's based on a [BYU paper](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/ETD/image/etd1527.pdf) [PDF].
