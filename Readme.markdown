Shumai (pronounced "Shoe-my") is _the_ open-source inertial nagivation software for fixed-wing aircraft. It provides realtime estimates to allow for higher-level navigation software to be developed.

For installation instructions (you _will_ need to follow these if you want to get it working), more details and photos go to [http://dronedynamics.com/shumai/](http://dronedynamics.com/shumai/).
